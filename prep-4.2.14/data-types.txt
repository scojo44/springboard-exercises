1. Create the following variables...

   let name = "Scott";
   const dayOfBirth = 7;

2. See what happens when you have multiple variables of the same name. Which one takes precedence?

   The first one to be declared takes precedence.
   The second declaration in the same scope causes an error.

3. Write some JavaScript that prompts the user for their favorite color.  Once the user has
   submitted a favorite color, log that color to the console along with a friendly message.

   let favoriteColor = prompt("Please enter your favorite color:");
   console.log(`Great color!  You chose ${favoriteColor}.`);

4. Create a string that contains both single quotes and double quotes.

   let tag = '<img src="snowy-mountains.jpeg">';
   
5. What is the difference between null and undefined?

   A variable declared without setting a value is undefined while null means it was intentionally
   set without a value.  Put another way, undefined is like a blank page, while null is the page
   that says "This page intentionally left blank."

6. What is NaN in JavaScript? What is the typeof NaN?

   NaN means the result of the numerical operation turned out to be not a number, like dividing
   by 0 or multiplying four by "abc."
   "typeof NaN" gives "number" even though it means "not a number."

7. You can declare a variable by typing let thing;. What is the value of thing?

   undefined (because we haven't gotten around to assigning it a value.)
