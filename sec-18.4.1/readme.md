# My Experience with a networking event

I attended an online event called [Useful Strategies For Landing Your First Frontend Web Development Job](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-web-development-club/events/297352874/).  It started with brief introductions with several of us giving short versions of our elevator pitches, including me.  Then there was a 15 minute presentation on the title topic.  Finally, the last hour was a question and answer session where the host and other attendees chimed in with answers and advice.

At its peak, there was at least 50 people.  I gained a couple dozen LinkedIn connections and collected several new tech learning sites to check out.  I will definately will do more events!
