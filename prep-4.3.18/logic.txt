/***** Part 1 *****/

Write down what the following statements will return.
Try to figure this out before putting the commands in
the chrome console.

1. 2 == “2”;      // true
2. 2 === 2;       // true
3. 10 % 3;        // 1
4. 10 % 3 === 1;  // true
5. true && false; // false
6. false || true; // true
7. true || false; // true

/***** Part 2 *****/

> Answer the following questions about this code block:

let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
  console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
  console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}

> What should the above code console.log?

"Keep it up!" because isLearning is true so the if block is ran
but the else block is skipped.

> Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)?
> Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?

isLearning is a boolean type with its value set to true.
That makes it truthy, which means it has a value considered to be true.

> Answer the following questions about this code block:

let firstVariable;
let secondVariable = "";
let thirdVariable = 1;
let secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstVariable){
  console.log("first");
} else if(firstVariable || secondVariable){
  console.log("second");
} else if(firstVariable || thirdVariable){
  console.log("third");
} else {
  console.log("fourth");
}

> What should the above code console.log? Why?

"third" because the first two conditional statements are falsy and the third is
truthy because thirdVariable is truthy and we only need one side of the OR to be true.

> What is the value of firstVariable when it is initialized?

undefined because it was never assigned a value.

> Is the value of firstVariable a “truthy” value? Why?

No because undefined is a falsy value.

> Is the value of secondVariable a “truthy” value? Why?

secondVariable's value is an empty string, which makes it a falsy value.

> Is the value of thirdVariable a “truthy” value? Why?

As a number, thirdVariable is truthy because it's not zero.

/***** Part 3 *****/

> Write an if statement that console.log’s “Over 0.5” if Math.random
> returns a number greater than 0.5.  Otherwise console.log “Under 0.5”.

if(Math.random() > .5){
   console.log("Over 0.5");
}
else {
   console.log("Under 0.5");
}

> What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.

Falsy means the value is considered to be false when evaluated in a conditional
statement.  The falsy values in JavaScript are false, 0, "", undefined, null, NaN
